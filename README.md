### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Sophomore at St. Lawrence University, working on a Data Science and History double major. I enjoy working with sports analytics, especially baseball. I am also a member of the women's rowing team at SLU. Previously, I did competitive nordic skiing in Oslo, Norway. I enjoy coding in Python and R and I got my start using Scratch in first grade.
