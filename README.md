### Hi there 👋

I am a Junior at St. Lawrence University, working on a Data Science and History double major. I enjoy working with sports analytics, especially baseball. I am also a member of the women's rowing team at SLU. Previously, I did competitive nordic skiing in Oslo, Norway. I enjoy coding in Python and R and I got my start using Scratch in first grade. I often post code related to sports analystics and data visualization. This summer, I got to work on the SCORE Network Summer Fellowship at St. Lawrence. I greatly enjoyed making data modules for a variety of sports, my favorite part was getting to prepare data for the modules.
